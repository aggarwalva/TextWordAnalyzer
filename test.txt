“I remember the only time I ever saw my mother cry. I was eating apricot pie.”
“I remember that life was just as serious then as it is now.”

“I remember once losing my nickel in the grass before he made it to my house.”
“I remember ringworms. And name tags.”
“I remember the first erection I distinctly remember having. It was by the side of a public swimming pool. I was sunning on my back on a towel.
